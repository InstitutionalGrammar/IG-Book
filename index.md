## Institutional Grammar

The Institutional Grammar describes an approach to systematically study institutions by representing those in terms of syntactic and semantic structures that capture the institutions in terms of parseable institutional statements reflecting the content of the studied institution, whether in form (e.g., policies) or in use (e.g., field studies). Originally devised by Crawford and Ostrom in 1995, the "Grammar of Institutions" offers a regulative syntax that captures the prototypical structure of institutions in terms of institutional statements. 

Since this original inception, the "Institutional Grammar" (IG) has been applied in diverse domains and areas of applications as well as analytical techniques, drawing the linkage between fields such as policy studies specifically, and institutional analysis more generally. Empirical observations as well as have led to a series of variants, challenges and proposals for refinements that have been integrated into what is referred to as the "Institutional Grammar 2.0", proposed by Frantz and Siddiki, which establishes novel opportunities for institutional analysis with the primary objective to develop the IG as an interdisciplinary interface, open to scholars across the social sciences, and independent of the nature (e.g., formal, informal) and form (e.g., written, oral) of the studied institutions, as well as applied techniques (e.g., content analysis, computational modeling, formal analyses).
