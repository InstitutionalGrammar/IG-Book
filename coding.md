## Coder's Corner

This page specifically targets common challenges encountered when encoding institutional statements. While those discussions are covered in the IG 2.0 Codebook, an overview of common questions alongside a practice-oriented explanation is provided here. We intend to update this overview based on observed challenges encountered during the encoding of institutional statements.

  <summary>What is the difference between Execution Constraints vs. Object Properties?</summary><br/>
  
A common coding challenge is to differentiate between *Object Properties* and *Execution Constraints*. To operationalize the distinction, it is important to identify the entity the property or constraint in question refers to. Where *Object Properties* provide additional characterizations for an *Attribute*, *Object* variants (for regulative statements), *Constituted Entity* or *Constituting Properties* components (for constitutive statements), Execution constraints *qualify* the activity, i.e., the Aim (for the case of regulative statements), or Constitutive Function (in the case of a constitutive statement) of a statement. Conceptually, Property act as second-order descriptor of components that describe or reference entities, whereas Execution Constraints act as second-order descriptors of Aims or Constitutive Function, often indicating *how* or *why* an activity is performed (Note that various other types of execution constraints are reflected in the *Context Taxonomy*). The following examples highlight this distinctive difference.
 
In the statement ```A(Citizens) D(must) I(submit) Bdir(tax returns) Cex(to facilitate a precise tax assessment).``` the execution constraint qualifies the activity *submit* by indicating why this activity is to be performed (here signaling the purpose). It does, however, not qualify the nature of the tax returns in any specific way.
  
The statement ```A(Citizens) D(must) I(submit) Bdir(tax returns) Bdir,p(that indicate past year's earnings).```, in contrast, includes an *Object Property* (Bdir,p) that contains a descriptor of the *Direct Object*, i.e., the *tax returns*, and describes their content.
