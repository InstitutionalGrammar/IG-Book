# Book Talk Series
 
We recently held a book talk series on the recently published IG book (more explicitly: *Institutional Grammar: Foundations and Applications for Institutional Analysis*). The purpose of this series was to provide a forum to engage on the content of the book, both to seek clarity or discuss aspects of the book as well as to solicit feedback from academics and practitioners engaging or interested in institutional analysis. 

## Dates

The book talk series ran from 8th September to 10th November 2022. Meetings (schedule below) were held from 10:00 to 11:30 EST by Zoom. Across meeting sessions, we iterated through the book on a per-chapter basis. To foster lively and engaging discussions, we encouraged participants to read the chapter(s) corresponding to different meeting dates in advance.
