# Graduate IG Training (Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Gjøvik)

We will hold the second edition of our on-site training on the Institutional Grammar at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Gjøvik, in conjunction with the annual IGRI Institutional Analysis with the Institutional Grammar training. 

The format is two-fold, with the first component being the virtual sessions that provide practical insight into engaging in the operational planning of IG studies and coding of institutional statements. This part is open to everyone registering for the training and entirely virtual. The registration can be found [here](https://institutionalgrammar.org/training/institutional-analysis-with-the-institutional-grammar-2023/).

The second part is focused on advanced doctoral students seeking feedback on their study design as well as application of the IG. Participation in this part requires early application by providing a motivation for participation.

The schedule for the combined event can be found [here](https://institutionalgrammar.org/doctoral_workshop/2023-igri-doctoral-workshop/)
