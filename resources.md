## Resources

The Institutional Grammar 2.0 is supported by a wide range of resources that address different objectives, including conceptual aspects and practical concerns regarding the coding of institutional statements, as well as tools that support the process.

Resources related to the Institutional Grammar more broadly (i.e., specifically resources related to the original Institutional Grammar) can be found on the [IGRI website](https://institutionalgrammar.org/resources/).

### Conceptual Foundations & Supplementary Information

Conceptual and theoretical guidance is offered by the original Public Administration article, as well as the comprehensive coverage in the book.
