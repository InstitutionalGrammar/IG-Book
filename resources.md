## Resources

The Institutional Grammar 2.0 is supported by a wide range of resources that address different objectives, including conceptual aspects and practical concerns regarding the coding of institutional statements, as well as tools that support the process.

Resources related to the Institutional Grammar more broadly (i.e., specifically resources related to the original Institutional Grammar) can be found on the [IGRI website](https://institutionalgrammar.org/resources/).

### Conceptual Foundations & Supplementary Information

Conceptual and theoretical guidance is offered by the original Public Administration article, as well as the comprehensive coverage in the book.

### Cheat Sheet & Coding Guidance

Operational guidance for the encoding of institutional information is provided in the frequently updated IG 2.0 Codebook. A brief conceptual overview is provided in the IG 2.0 Cheat Sheet.

### Additional Resources (Software, Videos, etc.)

[IG Parser](ig-parser.md) -- The IG Parser is a software tool to support the encoding of institutional statements, in order to provide different outputs (currently a tabular output and visual output, similar to the visualizations in the book) for further processing.

We are further in the process of developing introductory video resources as well as additional software tools to support the encoding and analysis of institutional statements, which will be listed here once they become available.
