This page lists a selection of events related to the Institutional Grammar 2.0, both including events we held in the past, as well as upcoming ones. Where relevant, further details are provided for the corresponding event.

## November 2022: Master Class (University of Milan)

In November, we were invited to hold a two-day Master Class on the Institutional Grammar at the Department of Political Science at the University of Milan. During the event, we covered both theoretical and intellectual foundations of the Institutional Grammar, but also discussed the practical engagement in encoding and analyzing institutional information for a variety of analytical applications.

## Autumn/Fall 2022: Book Talk Series

Over the autumn/fall 2022, we held a nine-session book talk series in which we discussed key concepts and applications of the Institutional Grammar, orienting along the general themes offered by the individual book chapters, inviting for both theoretical and well as practical discussions related to research design and the application of the Institutional Grammar.

## June 2022: Graduate IG Training (University of Colorado Denver)

We held our first on-site training on the Institutional Grammar at the University of Colorado, Denver, in conjunction with the annual IGRI Virtual Conference. The format allowed intensive groupwork with a selection of graduate students from all over the US who engage with the Institutional Grammar as part of their research. Similar events are planned for the future.

## April-May 2022: Institutional Grammar Online Training

We held a multi-week virtual training course on the Institutional Grammar 2.0, with a combination of independent learning via available resources (e.g., videos), alongside interactive teaching and discussion sessions spread over four weeks. This followed an initial iteration of that format in 2021.
