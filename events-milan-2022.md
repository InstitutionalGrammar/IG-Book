# Master Class at the University of Milan (November 2022)

The Master Class will take place at the Department of Social and Political Sciences at the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (UniMi), following a generous invitation by [Alessia Damonte](https://expertise.unimi.it/get/person/alessia-damonte) (a special thank you!). 

The two-day class will cover the intellectual foundations of institutional analysis more generally, and the Institutional Grammar (IG) more specifically. Following the conceptual introduction of the IG, a specific emphasis lies on discussing the operational encoding of institutional statements, as well as the analysis of the collected institutional information.

The Master class syllabus can be found [here](https://newinstitutionalgrammar.org/resources/IG%20Master%20Class%20Milan%20Overview.pdf).
