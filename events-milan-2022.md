# Master Class at the University of Milan (November 2022)

The Master Class will take place at the Department of Social and Political Sciences at the university (following a generous invitation by Alessia Damonte (a special thank you!)). 

It will cover the intellectual foundations of institutional analysis more generally, and the Institutional Grammar (IG) more specifically. Following the conceptual introduction of the IG, a specific emphasis lies on discussing the operational encoding of institutional statements, as well as the analysis of the collected institutional information.

The Master class syllabus can be found [here](https://newinstitutionalgrammar.org/resources/IG%20Master%20Class%20Milan%20Overview.pdf).

Further resources relevant for the Master Class (beyond the <a href="{{ site.path }}/resources.html">general resources</a>) may be posted here where relevant.
