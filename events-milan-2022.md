# Master Class at the University of Milan (November 2022)

The Master Class will be held at the Department of Social and Political Sciences upon invitation by Alessia Damonte (a special thank you!), and will cover the intellectual foundations of institutional analysis more generally, and the Institutional Grammar (IG) more specifically. Following the conceptual introduction of the IG, a specific emphasis lies on discussing the operational encoding of institutional statements, as well as the analysis of the collected institutional information.


The Master class syllabus can be found [here](https://newinstitutionalgrammar.org/resources/IG%20Master%20Class%20Milan%20Overview.pdf).

Further resources relevant for the Master Class (beyond the <a href="{{ site.path }}/resources.html">general resources</a>) may be posted here closer to the time.
