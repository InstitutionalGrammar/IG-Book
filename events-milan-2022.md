# Master Class at the University of Milan (November 2022)

The Master Class took place at the Department of Social and Political Sciences at the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (UniMi), following a generous invitation by [Alessia Damonte](https://expertise.unimi.it/get/person/alessia-damonte) (a special thank you!). 

The two-day class covers the intellectual foundations of institutional analysis more generally, and the Institutional Grammar (IG) more specifically. Following the conceptual introduction of the IG and its use in contemporary studies on the first day, on the second day is dedicated to the methodological design of IG studies, as well as discussing the operational encoding of institutional statements. It concludes with an exposition of approaches to analyze the collected institutional information. The Master Class is targeted at graduate students without prior exposure to the IG.
